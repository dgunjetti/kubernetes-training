# Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes is platform to run distributed systems. It is a container orchestrator. 
It basically serves four objectives
- Create an efficient deployment workflow.
- Ability to pack workloads in available infrastructure resources.
- Improve application availability by self healing.
- Abstract the underlying infrastructure so that workloads are portable.

Kubernetes is API driven, container centric system. It is one of the most active open source project with close to 2000
contributors. It is written in Go. It abstracts the cluster implementation from workloads. So applications can be written once
run on any cloud provider or on-premise.
